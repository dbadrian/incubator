# Overview

# Desired "Features"

    * Cleanable Container (Disinfecting/Sanitizing)
        * [PlasticBox](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B019QCXS06/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&th=1)
            * easy to clean, robust?
            * potentially clear
            * no great insulation
        * [Styrofoam Food Box](https://www.amazon.de/Profibox-5x39-5x26-5cm-Wand/dp/B01IPWWMAU/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8&qid=1535116095&sr=8-22&keywords=styroporbox)
            * No view inside
            * how good to clean, robustness? questionable..
            * good insulation
    * Transparent?: Would allow easier monitoring/without opening  container (could be achieved by cutting awindow though)
    * Airflow (but with possibility to close off?)
    * Either round ducts to get in sensors, or hardwired sensors with outlets?
        * "Ambient" temp sensors + humidity
        * 1-2 Food grade sensors for insertion to monitor actual inside temperature (important for later, heat-producing stages)
    * Grid on the bottom, such that there is some minimal "airflow" beneath the food container
        * Will  this create any temp. pockets?



# Parts

    * Resistor Letter / Heating Pad, e.g., https://www.amazon.de/Adhesive-Silicone-Rubber-Heizung-Heizung-Streifen/dp/B016FEJFIM
    * Arduino
    * Food-Grade temp sensors
        * [ds18s20](https://www.amazon.de/AZDelivery-%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90-DS18B20-digitaler-Temperatursensor/dp/B075FYYLLV/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1535115401&sr=8-5&keywords=ds18s20&th=1)....wellt not  food  grade, but sufficient?
    * some ambient sensors + humidity 
        * e.g., DHT22 ... +-0.5 acc,...multiple...could be sufficient
    * small fans in air ducts to control/enforce airflow
